        <b>ACHIEVEMENT IN MY LIFE &#127891;</b>
    </div>
    <div class="colored-section">
        <p>
Alhamdulillah, throughout my 20 years of life, there are several things that I have been able to achieve. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Academic results</li>
            <li>Various levels of competitions</li>
            <li>Participating in social programs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On this page, I will show my achievements in academics. When I was 12 years old, I took the Kafa Class Assessment Test (UPKK). I successfully obtained 8As in all 8 subjects. The following year, I sat for two exams: the Primary School Achievement Test (UPSR) and the Perak State Islamic Religious Lower Certificate (SRAI). I received 3As, 2Bs, and 1C in the UPSR, while I got straight As, which is 6As, in the SRAI. In 2019, I successfully obtained 7As, 3Bs, and 2Cs in the PT3, which has a total of 12 As.</p>
        <p>In 2021, I sat for a major exam in Malaysia, the Malaysian Certificate of Education (SPM), and took 10 subjects. I obtained 7As and 3Bs overall. It is a very proud achievement. Honestly, I was weak in mathematics, but as time passed, day by day, week by week, and year by year, I finally proved to myself that I could succeed. For the first time, I guessed I got an A in mathematics. Besides my own efforts, I am also very grateful to the teachers, friends, and parents who have helped me reach this level. Not to forget the Lord of all worlds, Allah S.W.T., who has always bestowed His blessings upon me and my fellow comrades.</p>
