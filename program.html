   <h2>SOCIAL PROGRAM</h2>
    <p>
This time, I will share my modest experience participating in a social program at college. 
<br> First, I joined the 'SUKARELAWAN REVIVE MASJID SIRI 1' program. This program aimed to collectively clean the mosque area in a nearby village next to our college. Due to the neglected condition of the mosque area, Majlis Pimpinan Negeri Rakan Siswa YADIM Kedah organized this volunteer program to provide comfort to mosque users in performing their obligatory prayers here. 
<br> This program greatly helped in cultivating humility and promoting cleanliness among all participants. I was very happy to gather and make friends with new people.

 This pictures were all taken before and after volunteering. It's such a good memories to remember!
<p>
Next, I also participated in an online Al-Quran recitation program during the last month of Ramadan. This program gathered students who registered and placed them in groups. 
<br> Each group would represent and collectively read 1 or 2 juz' of the Al-Quran. The period to complete the recitation was one month, which was the duration of Ramadan. This had a positive impact on the participants as it allowed them to draw closer to the holy book of the Quran and increase their religious practices.
